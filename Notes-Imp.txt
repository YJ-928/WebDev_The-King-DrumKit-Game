How to create a Object in JS:
objects in JS are created using " {} === Curly Brackets";

1. Creating a direct object:
var object1 = {
    yourName = "Yash";
    yourAge = "22";
}

object1.yourName = "Raj";
Changes the name from Yash --> Raj

2. Creating a General object: (using constructor function)

funcion details (name,age,gender) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
}
